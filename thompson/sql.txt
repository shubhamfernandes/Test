SELECT DISTINCT(product_variants.color) as color, products.title as title FROM products
INNER JOIN product_variants on products.id=product_variants.product_id
ORDER by products.id


Note:The reason i selected color first before title is 
becasue The DISTINCT clause filters out FULL DUPLICATE ROWS. 
It goes right after the SELECT keyword, since it applies to 
the entire row, not single columns. You cannot use it in between columns
